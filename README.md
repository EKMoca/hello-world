# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the "Github Flow".

My name is Erik Mojica and I am a beginner Software Developer.
I plan to become proficient in Python and other languages,
so that I can have a career helping create new technology in the field of Neuroscience.
I am on the road of Mastery to become a professional Software Developer.
